    "2.Choosing the optimal values of the regularization parameters (α and ρ) for Elastic Net regression is a critical step\n",
    "in building an effective model. The regularization parameters control the balance between L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge)\n",
    "regularization and the overall strength of regularization. You can select the optimal values through a process called\n",
    "hyperparameter tuning. Here's how to do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search or Random Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common approach to find the optimal values of α and ρ is to use grid search or random search. In grid search,\n",
    "you define a set of possible values for each parameter, and the algorithm evaluates the model's performance for all \n",
    "combinations of those values. In random search, you randomly sample values from predefined ranges. Random search is\n",
    "often more efficient than grid search for high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of whether you choose grid search or random search, you should always perform cross-validation during the \n",
    "hyperparameter tuning process. Cross-validation helps assess how well your model generalizes to unseen data for different\n",

    "Scoring Metric:\n",
    "\n",

    "Define a search space for α and ρ. For α, it typically ranges from 0 to 1, and for ρ, it also ranges from 0 to 1. You\n",
    "can choose specific values or intervals to explore within these ranges based on your domain knowledge or prior experience."

    "Elastic Net can handle multicollinearity (high correlation between features) better than Lasso alone.\n",
